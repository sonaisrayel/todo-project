Designing a Todo API involves defining endpoints, methods, request/response structures, and authentication mechanisms. Below is a simplified example of how you might design a Todo API:

**1. Authentication:**

You could use token-based authentication for simplicity. Users would obtain an API token upon registration or login, and this token would be included in the headers of their API requests for authorization.

**2. Endpoints and Methods:**

- **Get All Todos**
    - Method: GET
    - Endpoint: `/todos`
    - Response: List of all todos

- **Create Todo**
    - Method: POST
    - Endpoint: `/todos`
    - Request Body: `{ "title": "Todo Title", "description": "Todo Description" }`
    - Response: Newly created todo with ID

- **Get Todo by ID**
    - Method: GET
    - Endpoint: `/todos/{todo_id}`
    - Response: Todo details

- **Update Todo**
    - Method: PUT/PATCH
    - Endpoint: `/todos/{todo_id}`
    - Request Body: `{ "title": "Updated Title", "description": "Updated Description", "completed": true }`
    - Response: Updated todo details

- **Delete Todo**
    - Method: DELETE
    - Endpoint: `/todos/{todo_id}`
    - Response: Confirmation message

**3. Response Structures:**

Responses should follow a consistent structure, including metadata and data sections:

```json
{
  "status": "success/error",
  "message": "Some message",
  "data": {  }
}
```

**4. Error Handling:**

Handle errors with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages. Include detailed error information in the response body to assist developers in troubleshooting.

**5. Request Validation:**

Validate incoming data to ensure it meets the required criteria. For instance, ensure that the title of a todo isn't empty.

**6. Pagination:**

When dealing with a large number of todos, implement pagination to limit the number of results returned in a single request.

**7. Sorting and Filtering:**

Allow users to sort and filter todos based on different criteria, such as creation date or completion status.

**8. Security:**

Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API. Validate user input and sanitize data to prevent SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities.

**9. Versioning:**

Consider implementing versioning in the API to ensure backward compatibility as the API evolves.

**10. Documentation:**
